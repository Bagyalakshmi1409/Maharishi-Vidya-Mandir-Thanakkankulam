    <h2>About Us</h2>
    <p>In the year 2012, on June 14th, the school was ready to nestle children from Pre K.G. to Std XII. 116 walked in and were welcomed by a crew of 19 teachers. Though the cozy classrooms and the incredible infrastructure attracted everyone, it was the motherly care given by the dedicated teachers that attracted children from various directions. In the second year, 18 teachers stepped in newly, and 414 students were added to the MVM family. With the untiring efforts of the Management, Principal, and staff, the big banyan tree has spread its branches further to shelter 1000+ students.</p>
